# Frameworks

The outermost layer is generally composed of frameworks and tools such as the Database, the Web Framework, etc. Generally you donâ€™t write much code in this layer other than glue code that communicates to the next circle inwards.

This layer is where all the details go. The Web is a detail. The database is a detail. We keep these things on the outside where they can do little harm.
